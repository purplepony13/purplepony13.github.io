	<h1> <a href = "#Why"> Why</a> Tottenham Hotspur are the WORST team in history </h1>
	
	<h2> Bried explanation </h2>
		<img src="images/spurs.png" alt="The worst logo of all time ">
		<p> 
			Tottenham Hotspur are a first division football club in England. They consistently perform below standard of any respectable club in the world.
			and continue to disappoint their fans on a weekly basis. Tottenham have never won the English Premier League, 1992- present, and the last time they 
			won the English first division was back in 1961, over 50 years ago. They will continue to fail for the seasons to come unless they begin to make some 
			serious changes and smarter decisions. To add to this, their team logo is a chicken on a beach ball, what a joke.
