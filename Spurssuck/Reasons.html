	<h1> Reasons why the Spurs suck! </h1>
		<p> There are countless reasons why Tottenham Hotspur are a disappointment of a football club, however it would take far to long to list them all,
			and they don't deserve that amount of time and commitment. So here are a few of the more important and bigger reasons why they are so awfull.
		</p>
	<h2> 5 main contributing points to their failure  </h2>
		<ul>
			<li> They sell vital players to their club, for example Gareth Bale, one of the best young talents in all of Europe, for about 100 million dollars!
			Which is almost enough to buy a team of eleven decent players. They then outrageously overpay for flops like Saldado, who can only score penalty kicks.
			What a waste....</li>
			
			<li> They play the most unappealing type of modern day football (other than Chelsea of course) by sitting back and letting one player do all the work,
			which was Bale a few seasons ago and now Harry Kane, who at the end of this season will be sold for a lot of money that goes to waste on overrated talent.</li>
			
			<li> Tottenham cannot seem to decide on a manager each season, with a new one coming in more often than it should happen. Managers are being sacked
			due to their poor results week after week, and they hope to see positive change from this? Each manager has their own tactics and style, and the players
			must adapt to this, which takes time. By doing this the results will always get worse before they get better, but the owners are impatient and fire the manager,
			and the players yet again have to get used to a new playing style. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeG_i8CWE8"> Want proof? </a></li>
			
			<li> Tottenham always start the season fairly decent, looking better than the year before. However by Christmas every year, they seem to fall off
			the pace and drop many unnecessary points. This is due to the fact that they have no depth to their squad. They field the same eleven player every
			single week and expect them to perform at the same speed as the rest of the teams. Players are human after all and need a rest once and a while, for
			them to perform better the next week and get better results. They need more and better subs to rotate if they want to continue their form into the new year.</li>
			
			<li> After disappointing season after season, the top players have had enough and believe they deserve a better team, and request to transfer, then the cycle
			repeats itself. They overpay for more over rated players, managers get sacked, and the squad lacks the depth that it needs. This is why they will never get 
			better while this continues. They will only continue to lose support of their fans.</li>
			
		</ul>
